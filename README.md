Code Snippets

This repository is meant to be a long-term collection of useful code from a wide variety of sources.

The file architecture is intended to sort snippets by language, with one snippet per file. Each snippet should be stored in the appropriate type of file such that context highlighting will be triggered correctly.

The Contents.txt file will contain a list of the snippets present, to be used as a menu when looking for specific code.

The unsorted file is to accept new snippets. No file should be moved from sorted until its info has been added to Contents.txt

The mixed-language file is to accept snippets that involve more than one language. Any snippets added here should be contained within a new folder. That folder should contain files of the type for the languages used. In the event that the two languages must co-exist within the same file, a new folder should still be created to maintain the file architecture.
